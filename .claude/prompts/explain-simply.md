# Explain Simply Prompt

Use this when you don't understand something:

---

Explain this to me like I'm not a programmer.

- Use everyday words, not technical terms
- Give me a real-world comparison if it helps
- Break it into small steps
- Tell me what each part does

If you must use a technical word, explain what it means right after.
