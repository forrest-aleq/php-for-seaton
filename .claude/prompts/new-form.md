# New Form Prompt

Use this when you need a form:

---

I need a form that collects:
- [field 1]
- [field 2]
- [field 3]

Please:
1. Create the HTML form
2. Create the PHP that handles the form
3. Validate all the inputs
4. Save to the database safely
5. Show success or error messages
6. Escape everything that gets displayed

Make sure the form can't be submitted twice by accident.
